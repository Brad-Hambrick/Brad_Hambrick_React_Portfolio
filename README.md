## Description

This portfolio was completed using React and will be utilized to showcase my completed projects. This application is currently using conditional rendering, however I have code in place that can be quickly changed in order for it to be ran with either Hash router or Browser router.

## Badges

All of the coding methods in this project were those that were learned during the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp as well as some open source searches on React. React Bootstrap is currently the primary styling for the page and many of the components were drawn from there. Emailjs is also utilized for the contact form. There was some CSS alterations made to certain aspects and some of the application is CSS'd completely from scratch.
